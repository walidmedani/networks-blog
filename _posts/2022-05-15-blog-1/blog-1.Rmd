# What are your research questions and which data are you interested in?

I'm interested in analyzing how media coverage distorts bias or how hidden power relations in discourse are performed and maintained through linguistic forms.


Possible research questions:

US mediaâ€™s Anti-Palestinian bias through the lens of passive vs. active voice.

Sentiment analysis on the 2019 Bolivian Coup pre and post-American media outlet coverage.

Has media coverage of Neo-nazis in Ukraine shifted throughout 2008-2022?
